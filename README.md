The primary deliverable is the definition and implementation logic for three distinct trading signals: a Contango Short Volatility signal, a Backwardation Long Volatility signal, and a tactical Cross-Term signal. By operationalizing VIX term structure analysis, a portfolio model can gain a predictive edge, enabling proactive rather than reactive portfolio adjustments in response to shifts between "risk-on" and "risk-off" environments. These signals are designed to be integrated as a dynamic filter or a separate asset class within an existing multi-factor framework that includes inflation, sector, and risk analysis, thereby enhancing risk-adjusted returns and contributing to capital preservation.
